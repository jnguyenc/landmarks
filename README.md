# Most Beautiful Places on Earth

This is the front end for Beautiful Places on Earth web application. This application displays information and photo of the most beautiful places on our precious Earth, places that I would like to visit at least once in my lifetime.

This appliation is created by utilizing JavaScript React framework for the front end, and Java Springboot framework for the back end.

The front end application requires NodeJS to run. Make sure it is installed in your system. Then, run these commands:

### cd landmarks

### npm install

### npx start

Important Note:
If an API to provide the photos is not ready, edit Landmarks.js file, line 7, set the value to false.
const useAPI = false

## To do:

#### Create a Java Springboot RESTFUL API to supply information and photo of the most beaufiful landmarks.
